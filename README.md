# Annotext
Senior Project December 2020

Often times when students are searching for cost-effective solutions to buying textbooks 
for class theylook towards used books.  These books sometimes contain notes from other 
students who previouslyused it. Since we’re in a more digital age and most textbooks are
available in a PDF format, we figuredit would benefit students to have this available in
this format as well.  We’re proposing a web appli-cation that allows students to annotate
free pdfs of textbooks in a collaborative environment allowingclassmates and peers to view,
interact, and learn with other students using Annotext.
