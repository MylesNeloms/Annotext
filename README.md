# Annotext
Senior Project December 2020

Often times when students are searching for cost-effective solutions to buying textbooks for class. Sometimes they look towards used books.  These books can contain notes from previous users. Since we’re in a more digital age and most textbooks are available in a PDF format, it would benefit students to have annotations available in the form of our web application "Annotext".  We’re proposing a web application that allows students to annotate free pdfs of textbooks in a collaborative environment. Allowing classmates and peers to view, interact, and learn with other students using Annotext.
